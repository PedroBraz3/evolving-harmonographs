# Evolving harmonographs

This tutorial covers the implementation and application of a Genetic Algorithm on a generative design process. The goal is to evolve computer-generated drawings. In particular, we will be evolving [harmonographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph). To be precise, we will evolve a set of parameters that control the algorithmic drawing of harmonographs.

### Modules

The tutorial is structured as a series of modules:

1. Hello harmonograph
2. Random harmonographs
3. Individual harmonograph
4. Population of harmonographs
5. Recombination of harmonographs
6. Mutation of harmonographs
7. Evaluation of harmonographs
8. Tournament of harmonographs
9. Elite harmonographs
10. Automatic evolution of harmonographs
11. Interactive evolution of harmonographs
12. External evaluation

Each module consists of a Processing *sketch* that implements and demonstrates a particular evolutionary concept or mechanism. The modules are linked and sequenced to pave the way for the development of an evolutionary design system at the end.

### Prerequisites

- Intermediate knowledge of Processing (including the ability to work with arrays and classes)
