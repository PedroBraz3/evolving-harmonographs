## Individual Harmonograph

This program introduces the Harmonograph class which will be used (and expanded with more features) in the next modules.

### Challenge

- If we don't change the parameters related to the drawing time (maximum duration and increment), different harmonographs will have the same number of points. Try creating a program to do morphing (animated transitions) between different harmonographs.
- Add a method to the `Harmonograph` class to import parameters from file.
